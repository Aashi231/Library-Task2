c)Used UPDATE statements to fix or add missing information.
d)Used DELETE statements to remove an incorect book entry.
e)Executed all commands in SQLiteStudio for testing and validation.

SQL Features Used:
- 'INSERT INTO' (including multiple-row inserts)
- 'NULL' values in insertions
- 'UPDATE ... WHERE' to modify specefic records as per the requirement.
- 'DELETE ... WHERE' to remove specefic entries

Tools Used:

  Outcome:
  The database is now populated witth clean and consistent data and demonstrates proper handling of missing values and record maintenance.
